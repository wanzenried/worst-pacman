# worst-pacman
A really bad version of pacman

the goal of this project is to produce a version of pacman, which will be worse, and hopefully harder than the original.

## Ideas i want to implement:
* the map changes all the time (i plan to implement this by randomizing the maze everytime the player moves)


## thing i want to learn during this project:
* [ ] real time graphics changing
* [ ] real time solids/boundaries/physics changing
